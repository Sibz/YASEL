##Yet Another Space Engineers Library

Welcome. The objective of YASEL is to make writing in game programming script of Space Engineers a much easier by using Visual Studio.

YASEL is comprised of:
* Visual Studio Project
* YASEL Exporter
* Helpful code library

### Visual Studio Project
This is made so you can build in game programs and use 'includes' from other files, so essentially you can write code the you can re-use in multiple programs. It does it in a way that the code hinting works, and also compiles without any errors.

See [The Visual Studio Project](https://github.com/Sibz/YASEL/wiki/The-Visual-Studio-Project) for more information.

### YASEL Exporter
This is included in the project, its an application that will copy your program file, along with all the 'includes' from other files, nice and neaty into clipboard ready to paste into space engineers.

### Helpful code library
The project also provides a library of helpful functions and complete classes for specific tasks.
